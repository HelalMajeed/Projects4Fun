# problem 1 addOne
is about adding one to a binary number 
for example if we have ```111``` and we add one to it then it became ```1000```

# Problem 2 goodIndex
given array of length ```n``` detrimne if after ```K``` number of moves possibly ```zero``` moves we can make ```a[i]``` the same as ```i``` 
if ```i``` is even then ```a[i]``` is also even and if ```i``` is odd then ```a[i]``` is also odd if it's possible then print ```yes``` otherwise print  ```no```
